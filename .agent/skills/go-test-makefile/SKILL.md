# Go Test & Makefile Skill

This skill provides a professional setup for Go projects, enabling automation of common tasks (build, test, lint) via a `Makefile` and standardized Unit Testing patterns.

## When to Use
- Starting a new Go project.
- Adding CI/CD readiness to an existing project.
- Wanting to standardize build and test commands across team members.

## Components

### 1. Makefile
A comprehensive `Makefile` that handles:
- **Build**: Compiles the application for multiple platforms (Windows/Linux/Mac).
- **Test**: Runs unit tests with verbose output.
- **Coverage**: Generates HTML coverage reports.
- **Lint**: Runs `golangci-lint` for code quality.
- **Clean**: Removes build artifacts.

### 2. Test Template
A `main_test.go` template showing how to:
- Use `testing` package.
- Setup/Teardown with `TestMain`.
- Write table-driven tests (idiomatic Go).
- Mock dependencies (basic interfaces).

## Usage

### Step 1: Add Makefile
Copy the `templates/Makefile` to your project root.
Update the `BINARY_NAME` variable at the top of the file to match your project name.

### Step 2: Add Test File
Copy `templates/main_test.go` to your package directory (e.g., `internal/utils` or root) and rename it to `yourfile_test.go`.

### Step 3: Run Commands
Open your terminal and run:

```bash
# Run tests
make test

# View coverage
make coverage

# Build app
make build
```

## Prerequisites
- **Go**: 1.20+
- **Make**:
    - **Linux/Mac**: Pre-installed.
    - **Windows**: Install via `choco install make` or use Git Bash.
- **GolangCI-Lint** (Optional): `go install github.com/golangci/golangci-lint/cmd/golangci-lint@latest`
